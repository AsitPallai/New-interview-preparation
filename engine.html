    <h3>Definition of an Engine:</h3>
    <p>An engine is a machine that converts energy into mechanical work. It typically transforms chemical energy (from fuel) or electrical energy into motion or mechanical force to perform useful tasks.</p>
    <h3>Types of Engines:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)</strong> – Burns fuel inside the engine (e.g., petrol and diesel engines).</li>
        <li><strong>External Combustion Engine</strong> – Burns fuel outside the engine (e.g., steam engine).</li>
        <li><strong>Electric Engine (Motor)</strong> – Uses electrical energy to produce motion3</li>
    </ul>

        <h4><u>Cooling System in Tipper</u></h4>
        <p>he cooling system is a <strong>closed-loop, water-cooled system </strong>designed to maintain the engine at its optimal operating temperature and prevent overheating under heavy loads.</p>
        <h4>Main Components</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Radiator</strong>– Large <strong>heat exchanger </strong>at the front; transfers heat from coolant to outside air.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Pump</strong>– Circulates coolant through the engine, radiator, and hoses.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermostat Valve</strong>– Regulates coolant flow; keeps engine warm during cold start and opens when temperature rises (~80–90°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Fan (mechanical or viscous/electric)</strong>– Pulls air through radiator to improve cooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Coolant Reservoir / Expansion Tank</strong>– Maintains coolant level and absorbs expansion.</li>
            <li><strong>Hoses & Piping</strong>– Carry coolant between engine, radiator, and heater (if fitted).</li>
            <li><strong>Engine Jackets & Oil Cooler (if provided)</strong>– Passages around cylinders and sometimes an integrated oil cooler to remove extra heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Working Principle:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Coolant Circulation</strong>– Water pump pushes coolant into engine block and cylinder head jackets, absorbing heat from combustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermostat Control</strong>– If engine is cold, thermostat stays shut → coolant bypasses radiator for quick warm-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Rejection</strong>– When coolant gets hot, thermostat opens → coolant flows through radiator.</li>
            <li><strong>Air Cooling</strong>– Fan + vehicle motion forces air through radiator fins, removing heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Cycle Repeats</strong>– Cooled liquid returns to the pump and re-enters the engine.</li>
        </ol>

    <div>
        <h3><u>Turbocharger</u></h3>
        <p>A turbocharger uses exhaust gas energy to force more air into the engine, giving higher power and efficiency.</p>
        <strong>Main Parts</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Turbine wheel & housing</strong>– Driven by hot exhaust gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Compressor wheel & housing –</strong>Compresses fresh air and pushes it into the engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Shaft & bearings</strong>– Connect turbine and compressor.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil supply</strong>– Lubricates and cools bearings.</li>
            <li><strong>Wastegate / VGT (in modern types)</strong>– Controls boost pressure.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Working Principle</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Engine exhaust gases spin the turbine wheel.</li>
            <li>The turbine drives the compressor wheel on the same shaft.</li>
            <li>The compressor draws in ambient air, compresses it, and forces more air into the engine cylinders.</li>
            <li>More air + more fuel = more power output without increasing engine size.</li>
            <li>An intercooler is often used to cool compressed air before it enters the cylinders (denser air = better combustion).</li>
        </ol>
