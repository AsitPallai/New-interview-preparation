        <li><strong>Air Generation & Cleaning</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engine drives Air Compressor</strong> → compresses atmospheric air.</li>
                <li>Compressed air goes to the <strong>Air Dryer </strong>(removes moisture, oil, dust).</li>
                <li>Then air is stored in the Purge Tank for regeneration of dryer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Distribution of Air</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>From the dryer, air goes to the <strong>Quick Service Protection Valve (QSPV).</strong></li>
                <li>QSPV distributes air to:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Front Air Tank</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Rear Air Tank</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Parking/Accessory Air Tank</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This ensures that if one circuit fails, the others remain functional (safety feature).</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Brake Application System</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>From <strong>front & rear air tanks,</strong> air goes to the <strong>Dual Brake Valve (Foot Brake Valve).</strong></li>
                <li>When the driver presses the brake pedal:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Dual Brake Valve </strong>sends controlled air pressure to Brake Chambers via sensing and delivery lines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Release Valve (QRV)</strong>is used for fast release of air from chambers, so brakes release quickly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong>Emergency & Parking Brake System</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Air from <strong>Parking Brake Tank</strong> goes through the <strong>Parking Brake Valve.</strong></li>
                <li>It controls the <strong>Spring Brake Actuators:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When air is supplied → spring is compressed → brake released.</li>
                        <li>When air is cut off (parking position or failure) → spring pushes → brake applied automatically (fail-safe).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Safety Valves & Regulators</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RG2 Valve:</strong>Balances rear axle brake force (prevents skidding).</li>
                <li><strong>Air Pressure Gauge:</strong> Shows pressure in tanks for driver monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>QSPV (Quick Supply Protection Valve):</strong> Prevents loss of air in one circuit from draining other circuits.</li>
            </ul>    
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Accessories</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra <strong>Air Tank</strong> also supplies air for <strong>horns, doors, suspension, or auxiliary systems</strong>in vehicle.</li>

    <h3>Flow Summary</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Compressor → Air Dryer → Purge Tank → QSPV → Storage Tanks.</li>
        <li>From tanks → Dual Brake Valve → Brake Chambers (service braking).</li>
        <li>Parking Valve → Spring Brake Actuators (parking/emergency braking).</li>
        <li>Safety ensured by QRV, RG2, and gauges.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>In short method to remember</h3>
    <p>In Tata BS6 tippers, the braking works with a pneumatic air system. First, the engine-driven compressor builds air and stores it in the reservoirs through the dryer. When I press the brake pedal, the foot valve sends controlled air pressure to the relay valves, which quickly deliver air to the brake chambers near the wheels. In the chambers, the air pressure pushes the diaphragm and moves the pushrod. This pushrod rotates the slack adjuster and S-cam, which applies the brake shoes or pads on the drum or disc. The friction slows the wheel and the vehicle stops. When I release the pedal, the valve exhausts the air, the springs pull back the shoes, and the brakes are released. For safety, ABS, low-pressure warning, and spring brakes are also provided.”</p>

     <h2>Why a Gearbox is Used in a Tipper</h2>
      <p>A gearbox (transmission) in a tipper truck is not just for moving the vehicle — it plays a vital role in how the truck can haul and dump heavy loads efficiently.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Gearbox in a Tipper</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Speed & Torque Conversion</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The engine produces high speed but low torque.</li>
                        <li>Tippers need <strong>very high torque at low speeds</strong> to pull heavy loads or climb gradients.</li>
                        <li>The gearbox reduces speed and multiplies torque, making it possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Control Under Load</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A loaded tipper (20–40 tons or more) requires smooth control at low speeds.</li>
                        <li>Gearbox allows driver to select suitable gear depending on load, road, and gradient.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Fuel Efficiency</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By selecting proper gear ratios, engine can run in the <strong>optimum RPM range</strong> → reduces fuel consumption./li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <LI><strong>Reversing Function</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gearbox provides reverse gear to move the vehicle backward, essential in construction sites where space is tight.</li>
                    </ul>
                </LI><br>
                <li><strong>Power Take-Off (PTO) for Hydraulic Tipping System</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In most tippers, gearbox is fitted with a <strong> PTO unit.</strong></li>
                        <li>PTO draws mechanical power from gearbox → drives the <strong>hydraulic pump</strong>→ lifts the tipper body.</li>
                        <li>Without gearbox, PTO-driven hydraulics for lifting load wouldn’t be possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Durability & Safety</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heavy-duty gearbox is designed to withstand high torque and shock loads during off-road or quarry work.</li>
                        <li>Ensures smooth torque transmission, prevents engine or driveline damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>How Gearbox Helps in Different Operating Conditions</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fully loaded, starting on slope</strong>→ Low gear provides high torque to move truck.</li>
                <li><strong>On highway (empty or loaded)</strong> → Higher gears allow speed and fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Dumping material</strong>→ PTO gear engaged to power the hydraulic system.</li>
                <li><strong>Reversing into tight spots</strong>→ Reverse gear helps precise positioning.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Types of Gearboxes Used in Tippers</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manual Synchromesh Gearbox</strong>(common in medium tippers).</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy-Duty Range-Selector & Splitter Gearboxes</strong>(for mining tippers, 9–18 speed).</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)</strong>in modern BS6 tippers for easier driving.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>For easy for an interview </h3>
      <p>We use a gearbox in tippers to manage the engine's power and torque efficiently. It allows the vehicle to operate at different speeds and load conditions, providing better control, fuel efficiency, and the ability to carry heavy loads without straining the engine</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Why we use diffenential in tipper</h3>
        <p>The differential in a tipper is a mechanical device that allows the wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds while transmitting engine power. This is crucial when the vehicle is turning, as the outer wheel needs to travel a longer distance than the inner wheel. Without a differential, tires would scrub, wear out quickly, and the vehicle would handle poorly, especially under heavy loads.</p>
        <p>In tippers, which often carry uneven or heavy loads, the differential ensures smooth power distribution, better traction, and stability, preventing drivetrain damage.</p>
